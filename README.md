# Comparison-of-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-using-PySpark
This repository presents a comparative analysis of Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms using PySpark, focusing on their application in classification and regression tasks. The notebook also demonstrates clustering on the Bank Marketing dataset, which has been processed to be compatible with PySpark operations.

## Overview
Machine learning models such as Decision Tree and Random Forest are widely used for predictive tasks. This project compares the performance of these two models on a dataset, using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification.

## Goals
1. Implement Decision Tree and Random Forest models using PySpark's MLlib.
2. Conduct classification analysis on the dataset.
3. Evaluate model performance and discuss the advantages and limitations of each algorithm.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, commonly used for machine learning tutorials. It has been preprocessed for compatibility with PySpark MLlib, with features such as age, balance, loan, , and response.

## Environment Setup
To run the notebook, you need:

* Python 3.x
* Apache Spark (PySpark) version compatible with your Python version
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Results
The notebook provides a comparison of the Decision Tree and Random Forest models on classification and regression tasks. Performance metrics are calculated, and the results are summarized in terms of accuracy and error metrics.
